# Longitudinal COVID Risk/Reward Behaviors & Mental Health Modeling
This project aims to examine longitudinal changes in risk- and reward-related behaviors and decision-making among a general community sample over the first year following the initial COVID-19 lock-down in the United States, which began in March 2020. The focus is to understand how these behaviors evolved during the pandemic and to identify the factors influencing these trajectories. This study was conducted by the <a href='https://www.mcleanhospital.org/profile/poornima-kumar'>Computational Psychopathology Laboratory</a> at McLean Hospital & Harvard Medical School.

## Study Design
The study spans from May 2020 to February 2021, encompassing seven sessions including the baseline. Follow-up assessments were conducted at two weeks, one month, six weeks, two months, ten weeks, and three months post-baseline. This design allows for detailed tracking of changes over a crucial period of adjustment to pandemic-related disruptions.

## Data Collection
Data were collected on a variety of domains, including:

- **Risky Behaviors**: As characterized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
- **Risk/Reward Appraisals**: Assessment of individualsâ€™ perceptions and evaluations of risky situations versus potential gains.
- **Clinical Measures**: Focused primarily on mental health, with a few variables related to physical health.
- **Coping & Support Measures**: Insights into how individuals cope with stress and their available support systems.
- **Psychometric Measures**: Standardized tests to measure psychological variables, offering a window into the psychological state of participants.

## Analytic Approach
The primary analytic strategy involves using multilevel modeling to:

- **Determine the best-fitting models** for describing the trajectories of risk/reward behavior variables.
- **Incorporate clinical, psychometric, coping, and support measures** to enrich our understanding of the factors influencing risk and reward inclinations or aversions during this unprecedented period.

## Goals
The goals of the study include:

- **Identify key patterns and changes** in risk-taking and reward-seeking behaviors across the studied time frame.
- **Explore the impact of psychological and social factors** on these behaviors to better understand the mental health implications of the pandemic.
- **Develop predictive insights** that can inform future public health strategies and interventions in similar crises.
